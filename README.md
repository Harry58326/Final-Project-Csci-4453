Our Project:

We decided to implement a project using existing technology. Our project aims to create an NBA players management system using mySQL. To be more specific, we plan to create a well-designed and user-friendly interface that allows users to filter, manage and analyze NBA player data. This platform will utilize the mySQL database and will include the following features:

Ability to add a new player: Users will be able to add new players to the database by providing information such as full name, team, position, country, age, draft category, jersey number, height, and weight. And we can find the new player in the database using mySQL query.
Filter by various categories: Users will be able to filter player information by various categories such as teams, countries, schools, ages, positions, draft info, jersey number, height, weight, etc. This will allow users to easily find specific players or groups of players that meet certain criteria.
Switch buttons for historical players and active players: Users will be able to switch between viewing information for historical players (i.e. retired players) and active players (i.e. current players). This will allow users to easily compare and analyze player data from different eras.
Limit results on the interface: Users will be able to limit the number of results that are displayed on the interface. This will allow users to focus on a specific set of players and avoid information overload.
The database will consist of at least two tables: "Common_player_info" and "Player_Stat". The "Common_player_info" table will contain basic information about each player, such as full name, team, position, country, date of birth, draft info, jersey number, height, weight, etc. The "Player_Stat" table will contain detailed statistics for each player, such as points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, etc.

Overall, this platform will provide an efficient way for users to manage and analyze NBA player data. We believe that this project will be valuable to NBA fans, journalists, statisticians, and researchers.





Different Roles:

Chenfei Peng:
Create the initial database schema for the "Common_player_info" and "Player_Stat" tables in mySQL.
Develop the user interface for the platform, including the ability to add a new player and filter player information by various categories.
Implement the "Limit results on the interface" feature to allow users to focus on specific sets of players.
Write and execute the frontend Cypress End-to-End tests to ensure the user interface works as expected.
Establishing a connection to the mySQL database and executing queries to retrieve and modify data.
Implementing an API endpoint to add a new player to the "Common_player_info" table and the "Player_Stat" table.
Implementing API endpoints to retrieve player information based on various filters, such as team, country, age, position, draft category, jersey number, height, and weight.

Harry Lyu:
Implement the backend functionality for the platform, including the ability to add a new player and retrieve player information based on various filters.
Develop the "Switch buttons for historical players and active players" feature to allow users to switch between viewing information for retired and current players.
Write and execute backend tests to ensure the database and API endpoints work as expected.
Writing tests to ensure that the backend functionality works as expected and catching any errors or issues that may arise.
Designing and implementing database schema, table structures, relationships and constraints that align with the project's requirements
Developing logic to switch between viewing information for historical players (i.e. retired players) and active players (i.e. current players).


Both:
Work together to explore more features of the frontend and backend
Write and execute the frontend Karma tests to ensure the user interface works as we expected. Also,  if any of the team members canâ€™t come up with an idea to pass the test, Harry and Chenfei would look into the test and have a discussion. 
Debug and troubleshoot any issues that arise during development and testing. Encourage each other if facing any problems. 
Document the code and project to ensure it can be maintained and updated in the future.
Continuously communicate and collaborate to ensure the project is progressing as planned.
Have a regular meeting every three days to update on the progress. Usually, regular meetings will last for one hour.
