Our Project:

We decided to implement a project using existing technology. Our project aims to create an NBA players management system using mySQL. To be more specific, we plan to create a well-designed and user-friendly interface that allows users to filter, manage and analyze NBA player data. This platform will utilize the mySQL database and will include the following features:

1. Ability to add a new player: Users will be able to add new players to the database by providing information such as full name, team, position, country, jersey number, height, and weight. And we can find the new player in the database using mySQL query.
2. Filter by various categories: Users will be able to filter player information by various categories such as teams, countries, schools, positions, jersey number, etc. This will allow users to easily find specific players or groups of players that meet certain criteria.
3. Switch buttons for historical players and active players: Users will be able to switch between viewing information for historical players (i.e. retired players) and active players (i.e. current players). This will allow users to easily compare and analyze player data from different eras.
4. The database will consist of a table of NBA players basic info: "NBA_Players". The "NBA_Players" table will contain basic information about each player, such as full name, team, position, country, jersey number, height, weight, etc.
Overall, this platform will provide an efficient way for users to manage and analyze NBA player data. We believe that this project will be valuable to NBA fans, journalists, statisticians, and researchers.

Tools will be used for this project:
Front-end: Angular
Server: Node.js
Database: mysql



Different Roles:

Chenfei Peng:
1. Create the initial database schema for the "NBA_Players".
2. Develop the user interface for the platform, including the ability to add a new player and filter player information by various categories.
3. Establishing a connection to the mySQL database and executing queries to retrieve and modify data.
4. Implementing an API endpoint to add a new player to the "NBA_Players" table.


Harry Lyu:
1. Implement the backend functionality for the platform, including the ability to add a new player and retrieve player information based on various filters.
2. Develop the "Switch buttons for historical players and active players" feature to allow users to switch between viewing information for retired and current players.
3. Designing and implementing database schema, table structures, relationships and constraints that align with the project's requirements
4. Developing logic to switch between viewing information for historical players (i.e. retired players) and active players (i.e. current players).
5. Implementing API endpoints to retrieve player information based on various filters, such as team, country, position, jersey number, 
height, and weight.

Both:
1. Work together to explore more features of the frontend and backend
2. Debug and troubleshoot any issues that arise during development and testing. Encourage each other if facing any problems. 
3. Document the code and project to ensure it can be maintained and updated in the future.
4. Continuously communicate and collaborate to ensure the project is progressing as planned.
5. Have a regular meeting every three days to update on the progress. Usually, regular meetings will last for one hour.
